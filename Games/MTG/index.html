                <h1 class="MainTitle">Multiplayer Testing Grounds</h1>
                <p class="GameDesc">This is a Pocket Code project that was made simply to experiment with new things. And this is the reason most people on the Pocket Code community know me for. (I was a really adventurous 13 year old lol. Still am today, exept I'm 2 years older). I had a lot of fun making it, testing with an online friend that goes by the name "Foelish", and spending 3 hours trying to fix an error in my code, only to realize I had to delete a few characters to get it working (Definitley didn't happen ðŸ¥² ). Any way, this page documents all versions of MTG and detais on how I made them</p>
                <h2 class="GameTitle">Original</h2>
                <p class="GameDesc">The OG, I made a quick prototype for it using a PHP webserver. When I first showed people it, they told me I was a nerd and told me that they wanted me to expand upon it. I didn't want to make a competitive game with it, since people with malicious intent could modify the code to give them an upper hand in the game. So I wanted to further improve the engine and add more slots. While I could do that, but that's no fun. So I did something else to further improve it.</p>

                <h2 class="GameTitle">Infinite Slots</h2>
                <p class="GameDesc">Yes, infinite slots. Rather than modifying the server to add players into a json file of data, then remove them when they leave. I did what Griffpatch did with the infinite slot games he's made. I told the game to replace one of the server's data at random. I still kept the amount of variables to two, since I knew there wasn't going to be more than 2 players on at the same time.</p>

                <h2 class="GameTitle">Remake</h2>
                <p class="GameDesc">In this version, I've completely remade the game. This time, I've remade the game in an actual game engine this time! (I made the game in the Unity Game Engine.). Besides a few other projects that I've made in the engine. I (somewhat) knew what I was doing. However, I haven't made an online multiplayer game in Unity before! So I used the Photon package and it was pretty straight forward, thought it would go to hell pretty quickly lol. The original game was made for mobile, though it took me 2 days to do it, and the mobile port's multiplayer didn't even work in the end lol.</p>
