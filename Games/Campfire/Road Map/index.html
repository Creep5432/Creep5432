                <p>This is embarassing and would hurt me more than it would for you, but for the old version of CampFire. (Back then when it was called Public Chat). I actually used a very limited and scummy free Google Spreadsheet API for hosting and a video tutorial to stitch it all together. But after a while, I slowly started to learn PHP. and with a server change, I was able to do whatever I wished without being limited to a shitty API. And without any limitations, I wanted to improve CampFire as much as possible. There's a lot of things I want to do for CampFire's future updates. I am on the fence whether to release this as one giant ass update, or slowly release the new features as seperate updates. I am hoping this would make CampFire more fun and engaging to be on and easier to use, but only time would tell.</p>
                <h2>Image Sharing</h2>
                <p>Pretty self-explanitory, you would be able to send images to the main chat and in DMs. To make the images more light weight, the images will be compressed. This feature has been requested a few times and I also wanted to add this sometime soon.</p>
                <h2>Advertisments</h2>
                <p>I have been debating whether or not I should start monetizing my projects for months now at this point. And don't worry, Campfire. Along with all my future projects, are staying as far away from forced adverts as possible. What I mean by that is CampFire will only have rewarded adverts. Probably for more coins or something else that isn't scummy as hell</p>
                <h2>Statuses</h2>
                <p>Not Discord's type of statuses, what I mean by that is posts that you would put on your profile to update people. Something similar to Twitter, Facebook, or YouTube's community tab</p>
                <h2>Profile Customization</h2>
                <p>For more diversity in user profiles. There will be customization options such as profile photos (Will possibly replace the custom emojis), about me sections, and usersites.</p>
                <h2>Account System</h2>
                <p>With a lot of features for CampFire coming soon. A username-only sign up system won't cut it anymore. An account system will be implemented to moderate and verify everyone's identity. A cloud save and load for cosmetics and coins will also be implemented.</p>
                <p>This is all I'm thinking of for right now, but I'll possibly add more things to improve the app</p>
