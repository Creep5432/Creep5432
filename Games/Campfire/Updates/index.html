                        <p>This is the first release!</p>

                <div>
                        <h2>Update Time! - October 31 2021</h2>
                        <p>Server has been overhauled a lot and the server was completely switched (That's why I procrastinated a lot with this update xd)<br>
 Changed the way messages look<br>
 Messages are now sent in real-time! no more restarting the app to find more messages!<br>
 You're now notified when there's new activity on the campsite!</p>
                        </div>

                        <h2>Bug Fix Time! - November 1 2021</h2>
                        <p>Fixed a programing mistake where your messages sent in the main chat would leak into your DMs<br>
 Fixed a programing mistake where the screen would scroll up every 3 seconds<br>
 (You don't have to update. Though it's best you do so you can get a cleaner, bug free experience)</p>
                        </div>
                        <hr>
                        <div>
                                <h2>Some Light Finally! (Not an update sadly) - March 12 2022</h2>
                                <p>After being abandoned for so long. I've decided to start working on it again. I'll tell you what I've added after so long.<br><br>
 Made some improvements on the server, now it won't randomly delete messages<br>
 Added a shop for Campfire, you get currency by logging on daily. Well, what can you buy with your currency? Cosmetics! To color your username. Here's all the colors in line, 
 there will possibly be more colors that will make the cut. as well as message colors</p>
                                <img src="./update1_1.4.png" width="295" height="415">
                                <p>There is now also a download the latest version button that of course, takes you to the download link of the latest version<br>
 And of course, There's a button that takes you to the RoboTank invite screen. It's kinda good plz invite itðŸ˜³<br>
 Umm, or <b>I will appear in your nightmares tonightðŸ˜³</b>
 So jokes aside, I have been very demotivated to continue working on projects like this. Mainly because of other stuff going on in my life. And for why I've stopped working on 
 Campfire, It was because I just didn't know how to stop the server from rolling back to a previous point. But that's all fixed now<br>
 See you in the campsite! (When the update officially launches lmao)</p>
