                        <p class="GameDesc">2 Player Games is a local offline multiplayer game. Simple controls using only one button to play. With a handful of mini-games, a color and hat customization for each player, and a freakin MAP EDITOR! Play with or against your friends in Versus and Co-op mini-games. Or practice with a computer in one player mode. (exept Keep Balance, the AI is too good) Play with a friend in Co-op mini-games and try to beat your high-score. How about customizing the speed? Game options are all decided by you. (Don’t play with people who don’t know what good rulesets are)</p>

I'm very proud of this one mainly because there's very few people that managed to make this possible. This happened when I was able to code in PHP (Please don't look at my server's source code. It wasn't good at all, since I barely knew how to code in PHP at that time)
