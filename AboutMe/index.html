        <p>
            I am a 17 year old boy.<br>
            My favorite color is <b>Pink</b>.<br>
            My favorite animals are Cats and Red Pandas.<br>
            Some of my interests are:  <b>Programming, Gaming, Art, and Animation</b>. ( I'm shit at the last three D: )<br>

        <h1 class="SecTitle">Programming</h1>
        <p>
            I started with Pocket Code and Scratch as a way to program, but slowly started to migrate from visual-based to text-based programming languages. (I actually still use Scratch from time to time)<br>
            
            I know Scratch (lol), HTML, CSS, Javascript (HTML and Node.js).
