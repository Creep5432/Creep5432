                <h1 class="MainTitle">Abandoned Projects</h1>
                <p class="GameDesc">Projects that I've either abandoned or temporarily left limbo for certain reasons. I plan on either reviving some or all of them sometime soon.</p>

                <h1 class="GameTitle">Survival Land</h1>
                <p class="GameDesc">My first big project of many. No, it isn't an action game (There was a spinoff to Survival Land that's about action, but I quickly abandoned it.). It's an incremential game. You pretty much click on things to get them and upgrade to get them faster. Was planning on adding more features to the game, like serveral dimensions, bluetooth multiplayer (or online multiplayer), simple minigames to get rewards, and plenty more.<br><br>So why did I abandon it? Believe it or not, I've actually been consistently working hard on it. However I learned that you had to back up your work somewhere (The hard way of course lololol.). My yellow tablet's charger randomly stopped working and slowly died off. I've tried to recreate it 2 more times but somehow lost the data for them. I've also made a few spinoffs to the series, here's a list of all of them:<ul><li>Actual survival game</li><li>AR game</li><li>(Doesn't count as a spinoff lol) Hacked version of the game</li></ul></p>

                <h1 class="GameTitle">Knife Strike</h1>
                <p class="GameDesc">It's a game made in Pocket Code where you stab other people by running towards them and touching them slightly with your knife to fucking kill them. There's several gamemodes wether it's by yourself, or with bots. There was originally going to be 12 minigames for the game. 6 with bots and 6 by yourself. I have also been planning to make online multiplayer when the multiplayer feature (Not the bluetooth one that came out a few months back, the one that literally no one gave a shit about) released. As of writing this, this feature hasn't been added yet lol.<br><br>Why did I abandon this one? I got lazy and got demotivated from working on it.</p>

                <h1 class="GameTitle">2 Player Games</h1>
                <p class="GameDesc">This game is actually in a somewhat playable state! Though I'll possibly remake this first if I were to go back to revisiting some of my older games. Have you heard of games like Supreme Duelist Stickman, Stickman Party, 2 3 4 Player Games, or Slapstick Fighter? What these games have in common is that unlike online multiplayer games, these games are local multiplayer on one mobile touchscreen. They have very simple controls (Sometimes even only one button to control everything) and usually offer a lot of minigames to play.<br><br> So I was inspired to make my own game similar to said games, and I wanted to do it differently so it sticks out from the crowd. I was going to add an online multiplayer system and a map maker (A very simple one.). But as I gotten more and more into the development, I wanted to add more features like 4 players and cosmetics. Howver I couldn't add them because of the way I've programmed them. So for now, I've left this game limbo.</p>
